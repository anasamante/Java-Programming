/*
* You're going to make a game â€” the objective of the game is to enter enough change to equal exactly one dollar.
* So, you're going to create a program that asks the user to enter the quantities for the following coins.
*
* You'll ask them how many pennies would you like?
* How many nickels would you like?
* How many dimes?
* And then, how many quarters?
* What your program is going to do is count up the value of all of the change that they answered.
*
* If it's exactly one dollar then they win the game.
* If it's more than one dollar, then you need to tell them that it's more than one dollar and how much they went over.
* If it's less than one dollar, tell them how much they went under.
* Feel free to change this game for your country's currency, so if you don't use dollars and you use something else that's fine
